### What is it?

An Arduino Portenta form-factor compatible board based around the Texas Instruments AM625 SiP (System in Package)

### What are the goals of the project?

  * To design a low cost, high performance Arduino Portenta MPU.
  * To help bridge the gap between MCUs and MPUs and create an easy path for projects to migrate to Linux
  * To showcase a 4-6 Layer design that is easily adaptable by the community, open source and built with KiCAD!



### What about software?
  * The board will ship with eMMC pre-flashed with Texas Instruments flavored Debian - traditional Yocto distro will also be available
  * Community engagement is encouraged, and OS Iamges can be flashed or loaded to the on-board eMMC storage or Micro SD Card
